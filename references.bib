	abstract = {Space-time image velocimetry (STIV) is a promising technique for river surface flow filed measurement with the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). STIV can give the magnitude of the velocity along the manually set search line thus the application of the STIV needs to specify the flow direction in advance. However, it is impossible to give the velocity direction at any points before measurement in most mountainous rivers due to their complex terrain. A two-dimensional STIV is proposed in this study to determine the magnitude and direction of the velocity automatically. The direction of river flow is independently determined by rotating the search line to find the space-time image which has most prominent oblique stripes. The performance of the two-dimensional STIV is examined in Kuye river and Xiasi river, and the results showed that it is a reliable method for the surface flow field measurement of mountain rivers.},

  abstract = 	 {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.}
